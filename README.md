## 🚀 About

This web app runs entirely in the browser — no server, no account required.
All user data is stored **locally** using the browser’s `localStorage`.

I created this project during my internship as a practical way to learn about:

* Web app design
* Persistent data handling
* UX/UI logic for real-world use cases

Even though this project started as part of my internship, **I’ll continue improving and expanding it regularly** — new features, optimizations, and design improvements are coming soon!
